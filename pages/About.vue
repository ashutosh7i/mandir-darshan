              Welcome to Mandir Darshan, a personal project born from a deep appreciation for India's spiritual heritage. As a solo developer, I created this platform to bring the divine experience of temple visits directly to your screen, allowing devotees and curious minds alike to connect with India's rich spiritual tradition from anywhere in the world.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">The Idea</h2>
            <p>
              The concept for Mandir Darshan came to me during a time when I couldn't physically visit temples as often as I wished. I realized that in our fast-paced world, many people face similar challenges. This led me to envision a digital space where anyone could experience the peace and spiritual connection of temple visits, regardless of their location or time constraints.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">A Non-Profit Initiative</h2>
            <p>
              Mandir Darshan is a non-profit initiative. While I initially created it for personal use, I realized its potential to benefit a wider audience. By making it freely accessible, I hope to share this spiritual journey with everyone who seeks it.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Vision for the Future</h2>
            <p>
              My vision for Mandir Darshan goes beyond being just a website â€“ I see it as a digital pilgrimage that transcends geographical boundaries. As a solo developer, I'm committed to continually improving and expanding this platform. I hope to preserve and promote India's spiritual heritage, making it accessible to future generations and global audiences.

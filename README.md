## Mandir Darshan 🙏
Welcome to Mandir Darshan, this is a personal project, and I do not want to make any profit or money from it, I have no such intention behind it. I made it to solve my urge to see bhagwan ji often.

### The Idea ✨
The concept for Mandir Darshan came to me during a time when I couldn't physically visit temples as often as I wished. I realized that in our fast-paced world, many people face similar challenges. This led me to envision a digital space where anyone could experience the peace and spiritual connection of temple visits, regardless of their location or time constraints.

### Key Features 🌟
- Live Darshan: Experience real-time video feeds from multiple temples across India.
- Temple Information: Access detailed information about each temple's history, significance, and aarti timings.
- Quick Darshan: A unique feature that allows you to have a curated experience of multiple temples in succession.[in progress]
- Community Contributions: Users can suggest new temples to be added to our platform, fostering a growing community of virtual pilgrims.
- A Non-Profit Initiative 🕊️

Mandir Darshan is a non-profit initiative. While I initially created it for personal use, I realized its potential to benefit a wider audience. By making it freely accessible, I hope to share this spiritual journey with everyone who seeks it.

### Vision for the Future 🌅
my only vision was to share this awesome thing with like minded people, if you liked it, try to do something like this for mankind, to make peoples life easier, by this you will make yourself, God and me, all happy.
